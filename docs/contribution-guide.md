# Contribution Guide

- **Setup** `flutter pub get` then `flutter run`. Install Android/iOS toolchains when targeting those builds.
- **Branches** Work off feature branches (`feat/<topic>`). Never push directly to `main`.
- **Before PR** Run `flutter test`, fix lints, attach screenshots for UI changes.
- **Standards** Follow `docs/coding-standards.md` and theme/i18n rules in `docs/coding-rules/`.
- **Commits** Use Conventional Commit prefixes.
- **Reviews** Keep pull requests focused and reply quickly to comments.
