## Tips

### Quick Delete Workflow
- Press `Delete` → `Enter` for safe trash deletion
- Press `Shift + Delete` → `Enter` for immediate permanent deletion
- The delete button is auto-focused for quick confirmation

### Type-ahead Search
In any folder, start typing to quickly find files:
- Type letters to jump to items starting with those characters
- Type the same letter repeatedly to cycle through items starting with that letter
- Search buffer resets after 1 second of inactivity

### Keyboard-first Workflow
Navigate and manage files entirely with keyboard:
1. Use arrow keys to navigate
2. Press `Enter` to open files/folders
3. Press `Delete` to remove items
4. Press `F2` to rename
5. Press `Ctrl + A` to select all
6. Press `Backspace` to go back

### Dialog Shortcuts
When confirmation dialogs appear:
- The action button (e.g., Delete) is highlighted and focused
- Press `Enter` to quickly confirm
- Press `Esc` to cancel
- Press `Tab` to switch between Cancel and Confirm buttons

## Platform Notes

- Keyboard shortcuts are optimized for **desktop platforms** (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- On macOS, `Cmd` key functions as `Ctrl` key for shortcuts
- Mobile platforms use touch gestures instead of keyboard shortcuts
- All shortcuts work only when the file list has focus (click on the file area first)
