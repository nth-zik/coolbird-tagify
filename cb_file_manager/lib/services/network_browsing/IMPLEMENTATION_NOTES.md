# FTP Implementation Notes

## Overview

We have implemented FTP file browsing support for the CoolBird Tagify application using the `ftpconnect` Flutter package. This allows users to connect to FTP servers, browse directories, upload and download files.

## Implementation Details

1. **Package Dependencies**

   - Added the `ftpconnect` package to `pubspec.yaml` using Git reference to ensure compatibility with our existing `intl` package version:

   ```yaml
   ftpconnect:
     git:
       url: https://github.com/salim-lachdhaf/ftpconnect.git
       ref: master
   ```

2. **FTP Service Implementation**

   - Updated `ftp_service.dart` to implement the `NetworkServiceBase` interface
   - Used dynamic loading approach to gracefully handle potential package loading issues
   - Implemented all required methods including:
     - connect/disconnect
     - listDirectory
     - getFile/putFile
     - deleteFile/deleteDirectory
     - createDirectory
     - rename

3. **Error Handling**

   - Added robust error handling for connection issues
   - Clear error messages for users when the FTP package is missing
   - Runtime validation of operations

4. **Service Integration**
   - FTP Service is registered with the `NetworkServiceRegistry` for seamless integration in the app
   - Uses the same UI patterns as other network services (SMB, WebDAV)
   - Tab navigation support using `#network/FTP/hostname` URL format

## Testing Notes

When testing the FTP functionality:

- Ensure you have a valid FTP server to connect to
- Test both anonymous and authenticated connections
- Verify file upload and download operations work
- Check navigation between directories
- Test file/directory creation and deletion

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for enhancement:

- Add support for FTPS (FTP over SSL/TLS)
- Add connection bookmark saving
- Implement transfer progress indicators for large files
- Add transfer queue management for multiple simultaneous transfers
